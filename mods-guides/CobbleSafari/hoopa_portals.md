# 🌀 Hoopa Portal

<p align="center">
During your adventures, you may come across strange portals floating in the world.
<br>
These rifts, said to have been created by <strong>Hoopa itself</strong>, provide access to unknown dungeons and dimensions… but their stability is far from guaranteed.

## 🌀 How It Works

Portals appear **periodically in the Overworld**, near a randomly selected player.
<br>
By default, they spawn every 10 minutes. You can modify this interval in the configuration files.

Each portal is linked to a **unique dungeon instance**, selected from the *Dungeon Pool*.
<br>
Once used, the portal transports players to that specific dungeon.

<p align="center">
Each dungeon is instanced: you are not joining a shared world, but a unique version generated for your group.
</p>

## ⏳ Limited Time

Dungeons are not permanent.

- ⏳ You have **15 minutes** by default inside a dimension;
- 💥 Portals eventually expire or are destroyed;
- 🚪 Players still inside are expelled when the dimensional timer ends.

Once the portal disappears, the dungeon instance is completely removed.

## 🎮 How to Use It

To activate a portal, **right-click its lower part**.
<br>
In most cases, a confirmation screen appears to show you the destination.

Always check the destination before accepting a teleportation.

✔️ If accepted:

- You are teleported into the dungeon;
- If you are the first player, world generation may cause a short loading time;
- You can leave at any time through an internal portal.
