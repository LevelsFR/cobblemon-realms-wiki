## 🚪 Accessing the Safari

### 🔹 Safari Teleporter

Entry is done via a **Safari Teleporter**:

1. Activate the teleporter
2. Confirmation interface
3. Destination display
4. Teleportation to the dimension

{% hint style="info" %}
<p align="center">
📍 Each entrance is <strong>unique</strong>: you never appear in the same location twice.
</p>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
<p align="center">
In <strong>Cobblemon Realms</strong>, crafting the teleporter is not possible. To access it, go to spawn using <strong>/spawn</strong>: the teleporter is located on your right.

## 💨 Pokémon Fleeing System

{% hint style="info" %}
Safari Pokémon may flee when they become too disturbed.
{% endhint %}

---

### ⚡ Flee Trigger Conditions

A flee event can be triggered during a critical interaction:

- ❗ a Safari Ball breaks  
- 🎒 using an item on the Pokémon  
- 🎯 direct interaction with the Pokémon  

👉 Each event has a **23.6% chance** of triggering a flee.

---

### ⏳ Flee Phase

When a Pokémon starts fleeing:

- ⚠️ a warning appears on the screen
- ⏱️ you have **5 seconds**
- 🎯 one final capture attempt is possible

If no capture succeeds:

> 💨 The Pokémon escapes permanently.

---

### 🧠 Technical Behavior

The system is based on the **Great Marsh (DPPt)**:

- a random number between **0 and 254** is generated each turn
- if the value is ≤ the flee rate → the Pokémon flees

📌 System base:
> 60 → approximately **23.6% chance to flee**

### 📊 Modifier System (Flee & Capture)

Levels range from **-6 to +6** and affect both fleeing and capture.
